^#5aa9d6;Allows hammers and axes to auto-fire while still benefitting from racial buffs.^reset;

This mod is required in order to restore full functionality of both mods. Requires Frackin' Races and Windup Weapons Auto-fire to work.

Check out Argle Bargles Easier Hammers and Axes or my own Windup Weapons Auto-fire for other windup options.
